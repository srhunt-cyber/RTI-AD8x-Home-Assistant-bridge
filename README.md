# RTI-AD8x-Home-Asssitant-bridge
This project replaces legacy control apps with a modern, unified Home Assistant (HA) interface. It integrates two RTI AD-8x amplifiers (16 zones), multiple Sonos players (including two Sonos Ports as inputs), and Amazon Alexa into a single, seamless multi-room music control system.
